<p align="center">heyyy whats up. im jackie. sometimes i dress up as generic ponies i designed for fun and sometimes ill be from a fandom. just depends. occassionally ill be online with my boyfriend. i mostly like going on ponytown to look at all the fandoms and the designs, so i wander around a lot.<br>if im asleep or away, im tabbed out. i dont strike up conversation often and usually only talk to compliment others, but if you want to chat ill talk if youre good at conversation. otherwise, im awkward and probably will just sit in silence.<br><br>i like 80s music, 80s movies, marble hornets, the x files, star trek, vinesauce, and other stuff. i have a real nifty website you can click on to your left, if you're interested to learn more.</p><br><br>
